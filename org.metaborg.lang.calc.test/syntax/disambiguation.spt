test plus is left associative [[
  1 + 2 + 3
]] parse to [[
  (1 + 2) + 3
]]

test power is right associative [[
  1 ^ 2 ^ 3
]] parse to [[
  1 ^ (2 ^ 3)
]]

test multiplication has higher priority than plus [[
  1 * 2 + 3
]] parse to [[
  (1 * 2) + 3
]]

test multiplication has higher priority than plus [[
  1 + 2 * 3
]] parse to [[
  1 + (2 * 3)
]]

test application has higher priority than plus [[
  f 1 + 2 
]] parse to [[
  (f 1) + 2
]]

test application has higher priority than plus [[
  f 1 + 2 
]] parse to [[
  (f 1) + 2
]]

test plus has higher priority than if-else [[
  if(e1) e2 else e3 + e4
]] parse to [[
  if(e1) e2 else (e3 + e4)
]]

//test if-else has higher priority than plus [[
//  if(e1) e2 else e3 + e4
//]] parse to [[
//  (if(e1) e2 else e3) + e4
//]] // should fail

test disambiguation is safe [[
  e0 + if(e1) e2 else e3 + e4
]] parse to [[
  e0 + (if(e1) e2 else (e3 + e4))
]]
